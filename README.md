## Technologies Used

The Reddit Clone project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Backend**: The backend is implemented using:

  - Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used to build the server-side application.
  - Express.js: A web framework for Node.js, simplifying route handling and middleware integration.
  - MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user and application data.

- **Authentication**: User authentication and security are managed using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and stateless authentication.
